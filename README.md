# miaro-scheduler-api

Simple API to know when my friend is working or not, given his unusual schedule.

This was mostly an excuse to use more go features such as datetimes and templates.


## Building

You can build the app by running:

```bash
go build ./main.go
```

## Running

You can run the following to run the app on local:

```bash
go run ./main.go
```

The API will then be listening on `localhost:8081`.
